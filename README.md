# VIS-LWIR patch dataset   

### !!!Note: The complete training and testing code (Integrates multiple networks) can be found in [[Link](https://github.com/YuChuang1205/RRL-Net)]

### A brief introduction to the VIS-LWIR patch dataset
VIS-LWIR patch dataset patch dataset is an optical and LWIR image patch matching dataset with the patch size of 64 Ã— 64 pixels based on [[paper(dataset)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7789530)] and FAST keypoint extraction. The dataset contains a total of 21370 pairs of cross-spectral image patches with equal numbers of positive and negative samples. training set : test set=4 : 1 (17096 : 4274).   


### Document interpretation  
1. "finally_train.txt" denotes the image patch pair information of the training set.  
2. "finally_test.txt" denotes the image patch pair information of the test set .  
3. Each line in txt denotes a sample pair.  
4. Take one line as an example. The meaning of the corresponding position in "9,235,124,1" is "Original image name";"The serial number of the LWIR image patch";"The serial number of the optical image patch";"The label of the image pair. 1 for matching, 0 for nonmatching".  


### Construction of the dataset
1. Download raw data [[paper(dataset)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7789530)].  
2. Build the corresponding dataset according to the image patch pair information in "finally_train.txt" and "finally_test.txt".


### Other supplements
To view the experimental benchmark based on this data set, please view our paper "Feature Interaction Learning Network for Cross-Spectral Image Patch Matching" [[link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251126)] published on *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*. It is worth noting that the epochs of all methods in this experimental benchmark are set to 40.
